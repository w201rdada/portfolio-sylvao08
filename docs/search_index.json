It may come across you when looking outside an airplane the cabin window feeling amazed by the very experience of flying with a heavy machinary. To me, this feeling has been with me ever since I joined the industry of Aviation. As amazing as it looks, Aviation is also an industry famous for its safety, efficiency, and scale. There is no industry that quite like aviation who is able to reaches a superb safety criteria, highly standardization and globalization all of which are driven by a complex but also precise manufacture and operation. Figure .: Life in the Flight Deck Abstract of my first cool idea - Predictive Fuel Planning Under the increasing economical and environmental pressure in recent years, Airlines are forced to lower their operation cost and improve their environmental friendliness. Fuel management is a critical component to address both issues. Predict Fuel Planning is to help the airline plan the fuel for their flights more accurately to reduce the necessaty of constant adding extra fuel. By locating the primary drivers and quantify their relationship with the fuel burn, we are able to better guide the fuel planning practice based on particular senarios. Abstract of my second cool idea - A Sky without Delay Similar to fuel cost, flight delay also incur significant operation cost to both airline and the passenger. Being able to predict flight delay and dynamically estimate the flight schedule is valuable for the airline and passengers to take according action to mitigate the unnecessary cost like waiting time and missed flights. By connecting different flight operation data sources and conducting analysis on the data, the dynamic flight schedule is able to provide reliable flight schedule based on the situation.

The worst financial crisis in the industry’s history over the last five years has forced all carriers to achieve cost efficiencies and higher productivity if they are to survive.” – Giovanni Bisignani – Director General &amp; CEO, IATA Per IATA’s latest fuel fact sheet, the global airline industry’s fuel bill is estimated to total $133 billion in 2016 (accounting for around 19% of operating expense at $44.6/barrel Brent of oil). If we take Southwest Airlines - a typical major airline in U.S – as an example, the fuel cost in the first quarter of 2017 is $921,979,000 which makes up 22% of the operating expense or 19% of the total operating revenue of the airline. This mean that even 1% of fuel saving could potentially bring significant improvement on the airline’s financial status. IATA Fuel Fact Sheet Southwest Report on First Quarter Profit Fuel as a Percentage of Operating Expense from AviationDB 1.2 A middle. While fuel price is undoubtedly a primary driver of the fuel cost, the airlines don’t have much control over it. The part that the airline can improve is the process of planning and using fuel in a daily basis. One particular step of the process that has significant room for improvement is the flight planning during which the flight dispatcher use the flight planning system to decide how much fuel that a flight is going to burn and how much to add to the aircraft. Currently, the fuel planning calculation is based on theories from physics such as the head/tail wind model and prescribed cruise altitude. The actual historical fuel burn data which reflects other operational factors about fuel burn has not been taken into consideration during the fuel planning for future flights, these factors could be the risk of holding, delay, detour and traffic. Without such consideration, the current fuel plan will be subject to inaccuracy. The only measure the airline can take is to add extra fuel to every flight to compensate any possible additional fuel burn and such measure will significantly increase the overall fuel cost. What we can do from the data science angle is to locate the primary driver of the fuel burn using historical flight data to see what kind of features and how much they affects the fuel burn of a flight. For example, we may find out that the cruise condition – specifically the altitude and the wind – is one of the primary drivers of fuel burn. Then we may want to predict the cruise altitude and wind, but because the such information is not directly available before the flight when the flight dispatcher is making the fuel plan, we might need to also find the correlation between some pre-flight information that could potentially be translated to the condition during the flight. Another way to improve the accuracy of the fuel prediction is to use the similar historical flights to the upcoming flights as training dataset from prediction. When the model is good enough, we could develop an application for flight dispatchers to review the predicted fuel burn when they are making the flight plan. This predicted value will influence the flight dispatchers’ fuel decision based on data and potentially help them add more accurate amount of fuel for the flights. 1.3 An end. The benefit of such analytics is multiple folders. First of all, the fuel prediction is not presented to the analysts in airline but directly to the flight dispatchers who make the fuel decision every day, which means the analyisis could directly drive better decision making; second, the value is presented to them at the moment of decision making which has the greatest influence on the dispatchers on making fuel decisions; furthermore, such prediction is not generic but specifically target a flight which will make the analytic practical. There are several challenges for such analytics. First, in order to reach a satisfactory level of accuracy, multiple data sources may need to be included, while some of them may be publicly available like weather, others may require private data from the airlines. Also, there may be obstacle from the regulation perspective since for many years the regulation has been requiring certain amount of extra fuel as part of the fuel planning process, the fuel prediction analysis may potentially lead the airline to deviate from that regulation even though such deviation is supported by data and analytics. However, regulation can be changed as long as the prediction is justified, and I believe using predictive analysis to do flight planning is only the matter of time. "],

Not only to the airlines, the passengers also suffer a great pain from flight delay. The time loss due to delay, cost of missing connection flights and other indirect cost are borne by the passengers. According to a research called total delay impact study by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the direct cost of air transportation delay in 2007 is as high as 32.9 billion dollars, half of which are to the passengers. http://www.isr.umd.edu/NEXTOR/pubs/TDI_Report_Final_10_18_10_V3.pdf It is easy to imagine that improving the airlines’ on time performance and reduce flight delay can have huge and compound benefit to multiple parties of the air transportation, the airlines will be able to reduced unnecessary crew or aircraft transfer, ad-hoc flight rearrangements. The passengers don’t have to fly to New York one day ahead for afternoon just because the flight may delay in the morning and so on. Before we dive in to how we can resolve the problem, let’s first look at the cause of flight delay and acknowledge its complexity. As one of the biggest industries in the world and covers global operations, no problem in Aviation is simple. Specific for flight delay, here are a few causes and challenges that the industry faces: Operation uncertainty Aviation operation consist of a complex series of collaborative tasks by various parties and it effectiveness is driven by multiple internal and external factors. Any deviation from the plan of any of these tasks or unexpected external factors can potentially cause a flight delay, for example, mechanical failure, late passenger onboarding, airport congestion and so on. Because these operation uncertainty cannot be foreseen, once it happens, it leaves almost no room for airlines to maneuver around and the flight delay will inevitably occur. Information blockage Another reason that incur the high cost of flight delay is that various parties don’t have enough information when they are making decisions for their step. Flight dispatchers don’t know that the airspace is already congested when he/she dispatches a flight into that area; the passengers don’t know their flights are about to be delayed when they set out for the airport. The air traffic controllers usually don’t have good visibility of the operation outside their managed space. Such information isolation will lead to different party making different or even conflictive decisions. Unknown Indicators of flight delay Even though there are potential indicators of an upcoming flight delay, there is no sufficient study on such indicator for the operational staff the understand and utilize to make their operation decision. For example, it requires analysis to say how much is the impact of a closed air-route to upcoming flights. Some events may have correlation to flight delay but we don’t see that way because the correlation is not easily seen. Challenges of consequential effect Flight delay is an result of accumulative events and can have butterfly effect. One flight delay are usually followed by several delays after it. When flight delay actually happens, it is still valuable to know the impact to the following flights so that related parties could react accordingly to reduce the butterfly effects. But this is challenging without sufficient study. 2.2 A middle - The Solution Although these challenges has hampered the traditional method to resolve the flight delay problem, the new data science methodology combined with the wide coverage of internet may provide a new path for the solution. The flight delay can be properly avoided and managed by a dynamic flight schedule prediction system. There should be two major components of this system. One is the dynamic flight schedule prediction function and the other is the dynamic flight schedule broadcast services. The main purpose of the dynamic flight schedule prediction function is to utilize various flight operation data stream to dynamically predict the schedule of each flights. As more and more data being available nowadays, we are more than ever before capable of capturing the potential drivers of flight delay. Such data may include operation status data such as NOTAM(Notice to Airman) and AIP(Aeronautic Information publication), traffic data like ADS-B(Autonomous Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), weather data such as weather report and forecast, historical flight data like QAR(Quick Access Recorder) and so on. With all these data, we are able to study how each factor play their part in affect the flight schedule and predict the flight schedule based on these study. For example, we will be able to know how traffic can affect the flight schedule or how runway closure combined with airspace congestion may affect following flights leaving and entering according airspace and airport. The insight gained via the study can be used to predict the flight schedule in the real time. The other part of the system is the dynamic schedule broadcasting function. Imagine every time when you check the departure time of your flight, what you see is not just one fixed time point but a predefined schedule and a dynamic estimated schedule. This estimated schedule is the prediction result from the flight schedule prediction function module above and serve to notify the passengers, airlines and airports about the operation status in the real time. Because the system is taking much more data than any human is capable of and is doing much more sophisticated computation than human, it is able to provide a much more precise prediction on the flight schedule than we currently can. Providing a dynamically predicted flight schedule will help the airline adjust their operation plan in time and the passengers could adjust their travel plan ahead of time. Such broadcasting can be implemented through various applications based on internet and make the information available to most people. To give an example, let’s say flight QC101 has a predefined scheduled departure time as 10:00 October 1st, 2017 and a predefined arrival time as 13:00 on the same day, it also has a dynamic predicted departure time as 12:00 October 1st, 2017 and predicted arrival time at 16:00 on the same day. The airline can choose to postpone the time of crew preparation based on the prediction and to announce the new time to the public. The passenger on the other side can delay going to the airport according to the prediction and the airline’s announcement, passengers who have connection flights can change their flight earlier than usual. 2.3 An end - The Difference This data driven solution may potentially revolutionize the flight operation schedule and planning process, changing the methodology from planning via coordination to planning based on prediction. Using the predictive algorithm, the operation uncertainty can be effectively predicted giving opportunities to proactive solution rather than the reactive approach used in the current operation. Not only can the prediction system predict the delay of one flight, but also it can predict chain effect(following delays)caused by such one delay, giving airline and passenger more time for adjustment. The dynamic schedule broadcasting also resolve the problem of information blockage, because all the people are looking at the same prediction, they are able to make more coordinated adjustment in their action rather than making different plan based on their own data which could lead to conflicts. A comprehensive prediction system based on data will enable a more efficient flight operation. "]
