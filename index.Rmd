It may come across you when looking outside an airplane the cabin window feeling amazed by the very experience of flying with a heavy machinary. To me, this feeling has been with me ever since I joined the industry of Aviation. As amazing as it looks, Aviation is also an industry famous for its safety, efficiency, and scale. There is no industry that quite like aviation who is able to reaches a superb safety criteria, highly standardization and globalization all of which are driven by a complex but also precise manufacture and operation.

### Abstract of my first cool idea - Predictive Fuel Planning {-}

Under the increasing economical and environmental pressure in recent years, Airlines are forced to lower their operation cost and improve their environmental friendliness. Fuel management is a critical component to address both issues. Predict Fuel Planning is to help the airline plan the fuel for their flights more accurately to reduce the necessaty of constant adding extra fuel. By locating the primary drivers and quantify their relationship with the fuel burn, we are able to better guide the fuel planning practice based on particular senarios.

### Abstract of my second cool idea - A Sky without Delay {-}

Similar to fuel cost, flight delay also incur significant operation cost to both airline and the passenger. Being able to predict flight delay and dynamically estimate the flight schedule is valuable for the airline and passengers to take according action to mitigate the unnecessary cost like waiting time and missed flights. By connecting different flight operation data sources and conducting analysis on the data, the dynamic flight schedule is able to provide reliable flight schedule based on the situation.
