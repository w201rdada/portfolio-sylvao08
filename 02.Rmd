## A beginning - The problem

"My flight is delayed, I don't know how long I need to wait and I guess the ticket for the connection flight is wasted."
"The aircraft has been holding in the air for half an hour and has to divert before the fuel tank run empty."
"The crew is reaching their duty time limit, the flight has to delay for another few hours before we can arrange a new crew to take over."

```
Having been working in airlines for years, I have been frequently hearing such statements and dealing with the problems caused by flight delays: customer compensation, flight rearrangement, crew transfer, unplanned maintenance, extra fuel, this list can go on and on. Not only to the airlines, the passengers also suffer a great pain from flight delay. The time loss due to delay, cost of missing connection flights and other indirect cost are borne by the passengers.

According to a research called total delay impact study by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the direct cost of air transportation delay in 2007 is as high as 32.9 billion dollars, half of which are to the passengers.

It is easy to imagine that improving the airlines' on time performance and reduce flight delay can have huge and compound benefit to multiple parties of the air transportation, the airlines will be able to reduced unnecessary crew or aircraft transfer, ad-hoc flight rearrangements. The passengers don't have to fly to New York one day ahead for afternoon just because the flight may delay in the morning and so on.

Before we dive in to how we can resolve the problem, let's first look at the cause of flight delay and acknowledge its complexity. As one of the biggest industries in the world and covers global operations, no problem in Aviation is simple. Specific for flight delay, here are a few causes and challenges that the industry faces:

Operation uncertainty
Aviation operation consist of a complex series of collaborative tasks by various parties and it effectiveness is driven by multiple internal and external factors. Any deviation from the plan of any of these tasks or unexpected external factors can potentially cause a flight delay, for example, mechanical failure, late passenger onboarding, airport congestion and so on. Because these operation uncertainty cannot be foreseen, once it happens, it leaves almost no room for airlines to maneuver around and the flight delay will inevitably occur.

Information blockage
Another reason that incur the high cost of flight delay is that various parties don't have enough information when they are making decisions for their step. Flight dispatchers don't know that the airspace is already congested when he/she dispatches a flight into that area; the passengers don't know their flights are about to be delayed when they set out for the airport. The air traffic controllers usually don't have good visibility of the operation outside their managed space. Such information isolation will lead to different party making different or even conflictive decisions.

Unknown Indicators of flight delay
Even though there are potential indicators of an upcoming flight delay, there is no sufficient study on such indicator for the operational staff the understand and utilize to make their operation decision. For example, it requires analysis to say how much is the impact of a closed air-route to upcoming flights. Some events may have correlation to flight delay but we don't see that way because the correlation is not easily seen.

Challenges of consequential effect
Flight delay is an result of accumulative events and can have butterfly effect. One flight delay are usually followed by several delays after it. When flight delay actually happens, it is still valuable to know the impact to the following flights so that related parties could react accordingly to reduce the butterfly effects. But this is challenging without sufficient study.


## A middle - The Solution

Although these challenges has hampered the traditional method to resolve the flight delay problem, the new data science methodology combined with the wide coverage of internet may provide a new path for the solution. The flight delay can be properly avoided and managed by a dynamic flight schedule prediction system. There should be two major components of this system. One is the dynamic flight schedule prediction function and the other is the dynamic flight schedule broadcast services.

The main purpose of the dynamic flight schedule prediction function is to utilize various flight operation data stream to dynamically predict the schedule of each flights. As more and more data being available nowadays, we are more than ever before capable of capturing the potential drivers of flight delay. Such data may include operation status data such as NOTAM(Notice to Airman) and AIP(Aeronautic Information publication), traffic data like ADS-B(Autonomous Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), weather data such as weather report and forecast, historical flight data like QAR(Quick Access Recorder) and so on. With all these data, we are able to study how each factor play their part in affect the flight schedule and predict the flight schedule based on these study. For example, we will be able to know how traffic can affect the flight schedule or how runway closure combined with airspace congestion may affect following flights leaving and entering according airspace and airport. The insight gained via the study can be used to predict the flight schedule in the real time.

The other part of the system is the dynamic schedule broadcasting function. Imagine every time when you check the departure time of your flight, what you see is not just one fixed time point but a predefined schedule and a dynamic estimated schedule. This estimated schedule is the prediction result from the flight schedule prediction function module above and serve to notify the passengers, airlines and airports about the operation status in the real time. Because the system is taking much more data than any human is capable of and is doing much more sophisticated computation than human, it is able to provide a much more precise prediction on the flight schedule than we currently can. Providing a dynamically predicted flight schedule will help the airline adjust their operation plan in time and the passengers could adjust their travel plan ahead of time. Such broadcasting can be implemented through various applications based on internet and make the information available to most people.

To give an example, let's say flight QC101 has a predefined scheduled departure time as 10:00 October 1st, 2017 and a predefined arrival time as 13:00 on the same day, it also has a dynamic predicted departure time as 12:00 October 1st, 2017 and predicted arrival time at 16:00 on the same day. The airline can choose to postpone the time of crew preparation based on the prediction and to announce the new time to the public. The passenger on the other side can delay going to the airport according to the prediction and the airline's announcement, passengers who have connection flights can change their flight earlier than usual.

## An end - The Difference

This data driven solution may potentially revolutionize the flight operation schedule and planning process, changing the methodology from planning via coordination to planning based on prediction. Using the predictive algorithm, the operation uncertainty can be effectively predicted giving opportunities to proactive solution rather than the reactive approach used in the current operation. Not only can the prediction system predict the delay of one flight, but also it can predict chain effect(following delays)caused by such one delay, giving airline and passenger more time for adjustment. The dynamic schedule broadcasting also resolve the problem of information blockage, because all the people are looking at the same prediction, they are able to make more coordinated adjustment in their action rather than making different plan based on their own data which could lead to conflicts. A comprehensive prediction system based on data will enable a more efficient flight operation.
