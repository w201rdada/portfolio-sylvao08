## A beginning - The problem

"My flight is delayed, I don't know how long I need to wait and I guess the ticket for the connection flight is wasted."
"The aircraft has been holding in the air for half an hour and has to divert before the fuel tank runs empty."
"The crew is reaching their duty time limit, the flight has to delay for another few hours before we can arrange a new crew to take over."
Having worked in airlines for years, I have been frequently heard such statements and dealt with the problems caused by flight delays: customer compensation, flight rearrangement, crew transfer, unplanned maintenance, extra fuel, this list can go on and on. The pain is not only to the airlines, the passengers also suffer from flight delays. The time loss due to delay, cost of missing connection flights and other indirect cost are borne by the passengers.

According to research titled the "Total Delay Impact Study" by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the direct cost of air transportation delay in 2007 was as high as 32.9 billion dollars, half of which was to the passengers.

Improving the airlines' on-time performance and reducing flight delays would have huge and compound benefit to multiple parties: the airlines would be able to reduce unnecessary crew or aircraft transfer and ad hoc flight rearrangements, passengers wouldn't have to fly to New York one day ahead for an afternoon appointment just because the flight may delay in the morning, and so on.

Before we dive in to how we can resolve the problem, let's first look at the causes of flight delay and acknowledge their complexity. As one of the biggest and most globalized industries in the world, no problem in aviation is simple. Here are a few causes and challenges that result in flight delays:

Operation uncertainty
Aviation operations consist of a complex series of collaborative tasks by various parties and their effectiveness is driven by multiple internal and external factors. Any deviation from the plan of any of these tasks or unexpected external factors can potentially cause a flight delay (for example, mechanical failure, late passenger onboarding, airport congestion and so on). Because this operation uncertainty cannot be foreseen, once it happens it leaves almost no room for airlines to adjust and flight delays will inevitably occur.

Information blockage
Another reason for flight delays is that decision-makers lack information about the whole flight ecosystem. Flight dispatchers may not know that airspace is already congested when they dispatch a flight into an area and passengers don't know their flights are about to be delayed when they set out for the airport. Even air traffic controllers usually don't have good visibility of the operation outside their managed space. Such information isolation leads to different parties making different or even conflicting decisions.

Challenges of consequential effect
Flight delays are  the result of cumulative events and can have butterfly effects. One flight delay is usually followed by several delays after it. When flight delays occur, it would be valuable to know how they will impact following flights so that related parties could react accordingly. However, these effects are difficult to predict.


## A middle - The Solution

Although these challenges have hampered the traditional methods to resolve flight delays, data science methodologies combined with the wide coverage of the internet may provide a new solution. Flight delays can be properly avoided and managed by a dynamic flight schedule prediction system. There should be two major components of this system: the dynamic flight schedule prediction function and the dynamic flight schedule broadcast service.

The main purpose of the dynamic flight schedule prediction function is to utilize various flight operations data streams to dynamically predict the schedule of each flight. As more and more data become available, we are now capable of capturing many potential drivers of flight delay. Such data may include operation status data such as NOTAM (Notice to Airman) and AIP (Aeronautic Information publication), traffic data like ADS-B (Autonomous Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), weather data such as weather reports and forecasts, historical flight data like QAR (Quick Access Recorder) and so on. With all these data, we can study how each factor affects the flight schedule and predict flight schedules more accurately. For example, we will know how traffic can affect the flight schedule or how runway closure combined with airspace congestion may affect flights leaving and entering the airspace and airport. This insight can be used to predict flight schedules in real time.

The other part of the system is the dynamic schedule broadcasting function. Imagine that when you check the departure time of your flight, you see not just one fixed time point but a predefined schedule and a dynamic estimated schedule. This estimated schedule is the prediction result from the flight schedule prediction function and notifies the passengers, airlines and airports about the operation status in real time. Providing a dynamically predicted flight schedule will help the airlines and passengers adjust their plans ahead of time. Such broadcasting can be implemented through various internet-based applications.

To give an example, let's say flight QC101 has a scheduled departure time as 10:00 October 1st, 2017 and a predefined arrival time as 13:00 on the same day. It also has a dynamic predicted departure time as 12:00 October 1st, 2017 and predicted arrival time at 16:00 on the same day. The airline can choose to postpone the time of crew preparation based on the prediction and to announce the new time to the public. The passenger can delay going to the airport according to the prediction and the airline's announcement and passengers who have connection flights can change them.

## An end - The Difference

This data-driven solution can revolutionize the flight schedule and planning process, changing the methodology from planning via coordination to planning based on prediction. Using the predictive algorithm, we can effectively predict operation uncertainty and provide proactive solutions rather than reactive ones. Not only can the prediction system predict the delay of one flight, it can also predict chain effects (following delays) caused by that delay, giving the airline and passengers more time for adjustment. The dynamic schedule broadcasting also resolves the problem of information blockage because all the decision-makers will be looking at the same predictions, which will improve coordination. A comprehensive prediction system based on data will enable a more efficient flight operation.
